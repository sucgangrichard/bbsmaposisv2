Hi! This is my first project!

I am creating this project for Chowking Muntinlupa Bayan, which will be the beneficiary of this system. This project includes multiple modules that provide functionalities for both the inventory system and the point-of-sale system.

In the inventory system, a barcode scanner will be used. However, before utilizing the scanner, products or items must be registered in the system to ensure they are recognized.

Additionally, I have added email and alarm notifications as features. Whenever the stock is low, or the quantity of an item decreases to less than 10, a notification will be triggered and sent via email.

I also implemented an automatic page refresh for the dashboard section to ensure it stays updated.
